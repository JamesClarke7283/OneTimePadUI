# Story 1

As a Case Officer  

I want to send/recive messages securely to my Source.  

So that we can communicate secretly.  



# Story 2

As a Government Official,  

I want to be able to have secure key material.  

So my messages are not decryptable.  



# Story 3

As a person with poor eyesight,  

I want the ciphertext/key to be easily reable, by spacing every 4 characters.  

So i dont make mistakes when writing the key  



# Story 4

As a person who has limited time,

I want to be able to print out the ciphertext/key.

To save time
